        <!--The <strong> element makes text bold. It also semantically marks text as important; this affects tools, like screen readers, that users with visual impairments will rely on to use your website. The tone of voice on some screen readers will change to communicate the importance of the text within a strong element. To define a strong element we wrap text content in a <strong> tag.-->

        <!--The em element makes text italic. It also semantically places emphasis on the text, which again may affect things like screen readers. To define an emphasised element we wrap text content in a <em> tag.-->
       <p>You may have noticed that in all the examples in this lesson we indent any elements that are within other elements. This is known as nesting elements.</p>
       <p>
        When we nest elements within other elements, we create a parent and child relationship between them. The nested elements are the children and the element they are nested within is the parent.

In the following example, the body element is the parent and the paragraph is the child:
       </p>
       <p>
        The parent, child, and sibling relationships between elements will become much more important later when we start styling our HTML with CSS and adding behavior with JavaScript. For now, however, it is just important to know the distinction between how elements are related and the terminology used to describe their relationships.
